## What We Do

At **REBIL**, we aim to redefine the car rental experience. Here's how we do it:

- **Peer-to-peer car sharing**: Car owners (hosts) can list their vehicles for rent, while renters can find and book cars directly from local individuals.
- **Easy, secure transactions**: The platform offers an intuitive, user-friendly interface where renters can view car details, choose from multiple insurance options, and make payments—all in one place.
- **Flexible terms**: Renters can choose self-drive or opt for a driver, and hosts can specify car availability, pricing, and delivery options.
- **Affordable & Transparent pricing**: Renters pay only for what they need, with clear pricing and no hidden fees.
